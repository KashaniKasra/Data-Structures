## Project Overview

This project focuses on the implementation and analysis of fundamental **Tree** and **Heap** data structures. These data structures are crucial in computer science, used in a variety of algorithms, and system designs like memory management, sorting, and searching.

### Key Features:
1. **Binary Tree**: A tree data structure where each node has at most two children.
2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A special kind of binary tree where the left child contains values less than the parent node, and the right child contains values greater than the parent.
3. **Heap**: A specialized tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property, where the parent node is either greater than or less than its child nodes (Max-Heap or Min-Heap).

## Data Structures Implemented:

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
  - Insert: Add elements to the tree while maintaining the BST property.
  - Search: Find elements in the BST.
  - Delete: Remove elements and reorganize the tree accordingly.

- **Heap**:
  - Insert: Add an element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.
  - Extract Max/Min: Remove the maximum or minimum element from the heap.
  - Heapify: Ensure the heap property is maintained after insertion or extraction.
