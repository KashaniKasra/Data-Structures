## Project Overview

This project involves the implementation of fundamental data structures: **Stack**, **Queue**, and **Linked List**. These data structures are essential in computer science and are used in various algorithms, system designs, and applications.

### Key Features:
1. **Stack**: A LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure. It supports basic operations such as push, pop, and peek.
2. **Queue**: A FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure that supports enqueue and dequeue operations.
3. **Linked List**: A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, each pointing to the next node in the sequence.

## Data Structures Implemented:

- **Stack**:
  - Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
  - Pop: Remove the element from the top of the stack.
  - Peek: Retrieve the top element without removing it.
  
- **Queue**:
  - Enqueue: Add an element to the back of the queue.
  - Dequeue: Remove the front element from the queue.
  
- **Linked List**:
  - Insert: Add an element at a specific position.
  - Delete: Remove an element from a specific position.
  - Search: Find an element in the linked list.
