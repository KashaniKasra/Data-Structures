## Project Overview

This project focuses on the implementation and analysis of algorithms involving **Recursion** and their corresponding **Time Complexity**. Understanding recursion is critical in computer science, as many algorithms use it to solve problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable subproblems. The project also emphasizes analyzing the efficiency of recursive algorithms using Big-O notation.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Recursion**: A technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the problem.
2. **Time Complexity**: Measuring the efficiency of algorithms in terms of the size of input data, represented using Big-O notation.

## Algorithms Implemented:

- **Factorial Calculation (Recursive)**
  - Recursive approach to calculate the factorial of a number.
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
  
- **Fibonacci Series (Recursive)**
  - Recursive method to generate Fibonacci numbers.
  - Time Complexity: O(2^n)
  
- **Merge Sort**
  - A recursive divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
  - Time Complexity: O(n log n)
  
- **Tower of Hanoi**
  - A classic recursive problem involving moving disks between three pegs.
  - Time Complexity: O(2^n)
