## Project Overview

This project focuses on the implementation and analysis of various **Graph Algorithms**. Graph algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are used to solve problems related to networks, paths, connectivity, and other graph-related concepts.

### Key Features:
1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using adjacency lists or matrices.
2. **Traversal Algorithms**: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) are used to explore the graph.
3. **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall are implemented to find the shortest path in weighted graphs.
4. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms are used to find the minimum spanning tree of the graph.
